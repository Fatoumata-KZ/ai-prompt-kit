# AI Prompt Kit for Strategic Briefing Notes

## Overview
The AI Prompt Kit is a lightweight prototype tool designed to assist policy analysts in drafting higher-quality briefing notes using generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini). It supports productivity, onboarding, and consistency across ministries through reusable, customizable prompt templates.

---

## Purpose
This tool addresses a common challenge in government: variability in the structure, tone, and quality of briefing notes — especially from newer analysts or under time constraints. It provides instant scaffolding for better drafts, clearer communication, and faster reviews.

---

## How It Works
Users select a prompt type (e.g., structure, plain language editing, summary), enter their content, and receive a well-framed generative prompt to copy into their AI tool of choice.

---

## Features
- Multiple prompt categories (e.g., summary, structure, editing)
- Plain-language guidance for policy writing
- Embedded branding and public sector tone
- Built with HTML/CSS for local or GitHub Pages use

---

## Strategic Value
- **Productivity**: Reduces blank-page anxiety; accelerates briefing note creation.
- **Onboarding**: Assists new analysts with format and tone; cuts training time.
- **Consistency**: Promotes shared standards across teams.
- **Innovation**: Demonstrates responsible AI adoption aligned with digital modernization.

---

## Responsible Use
This tool does not replace human judgment. Instead, it enhances it by:
- Embedding prompts that encourage critical evaluation and revision
- Highlighting the analyst’s responsibility to validate all outputs
- Providing ethical use reminders throughout the user interface

---

## FOI & Information Management
No data is stored or logged. However, users must treat outputs according to their ministry’s records management and FOI compliance standards. Prompt drafts, if saved or shared, may constitute government records.

---

## Future Integration
This is a **prototype** intended for low-cost experimentation. The long-term goal is integration into secure government environments (e.g., Microsoft Copilot), enabling the same functionality within protected workflows and with full compliance to data governance.
