# 🧠 AI Assistant for Strategic Briefing Notes

This applied project was developed for **JSGS 882 – Strategic Management in the Public Sector** to explore how generative AI tools can enhance internal government workflows — specifically in the writing of strategic briefing notes.

## 🔍 Problem

Briefing note quality and turnaround times vary widely across ministries. Many new analysts struggle with structure, tone, or expectations, while senior staff must invest extra time editing inconsistent drafts.

## 💡 Solution

This tool helps public sector analysts use **AI-generated prompts** to quickly create better first drafts. It consists of:
- A live, interactive web app for generating briefing prompts
- A downloadable Prompt Kit with examples and templates
- Ethical guidelines for responsible AI usage
